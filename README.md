## INTRODUCTION

People nowadays somehow try to maintain their physical health by doing exercises or by following diets and so on. Mostly people fail to look after their mental health. Many at times, we cannot find our mental state. 
We may be happy, angry, sad or depressed. 

Mental health really becomes important as physical health without proper mental health is of no use. The solution that we propose will address the issues mentioned above.

## SOLUTION

We have come up with a web app which monitors the user's mental health based on the descriptions of the user on that day. 
Using this web app, the user will be able to get a better overview of their mental health state and can accordingly make lifestyle changes.
Logo of the app is shown below

User can view a visualisation which will be based on the previous description of event and emotional states. Also the user can interact with the bot.
There are also three tasks assigned to the user that they can do to improve their state of mind.
